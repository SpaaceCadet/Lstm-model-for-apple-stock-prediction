# Lstm-model-fro-apple-sales-prediction

- In this project ,The  main goal was to forecast stock price of apple using lstm model .
- tried many configurations of hyperparameters , layers , cells .. and this is my best configuration
- The metric used to evaluate the performance of fit is RMSE , and i got lowest RMSE for test data in comparison with train data .
- The model performs better than the baseline  which uses a naive forecast method (moving average ) , we could use a linear regression model as an example .
